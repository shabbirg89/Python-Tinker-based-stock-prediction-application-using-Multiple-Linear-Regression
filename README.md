# Python-Tinker-based-stock-prediction-application-using-Multiple-Linear-Regression
This ipynb has step by step implementation of creating a fake dataFrame.
Built a MLR model based on it to predict stock price using its feature's using both statsmodel and sklearn
Finally create a tinker based application to predict the same stock price using the trained model
